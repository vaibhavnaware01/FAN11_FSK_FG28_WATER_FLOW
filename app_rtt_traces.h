/* 'Application rtt (stack) traces control utility
 * How to use this code
 * inclusion:
#include "app_rtt_traces.h"

Trace groups ids and trace levels are defined in gecko_sdk_x.y.z/protocol/wisun/stack/inc/sl_wisun_types.h
(in sl_wisun_trace_group_t and sl_wisun_trace_level_t, respectively)
The 'verbose' flag controls internal application console printing
Usage: Setting all traces groups to the same trace level
  It is convenient while connecting to set all traces to 'DEBUG',
   to monitor the connection in RTT traces using J-Link RTT Viewer
    app_set_all_traces(SL_WISUN_TRACE_LEVEL_DEBUG, true);

  Once connected, set all traces to 'INFO' or 'WARN', to avoid too many trace,
   then set selected traces to 'DEBUG', depending on what you want to observe
    app_set_all_traces(SL_WISUN_TRACE_LEVEL_WARN, true);
    app_set_trace(SL_WISUN_TRACE_GROUP_SOCK, SL_WISUN_TRACE_LEVEL_DEBUG, true);

#include <stdio.h>

sl_status_t app_set_all_traces(uint8_t trace_level, bool verbose);
sl_status_t app_set_trace     (uint8_t group_id, uint8_t trace_level, bool verbose);
